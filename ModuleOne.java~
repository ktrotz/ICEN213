/*In this program you will design and write a computer program to execute the following 
task.
Basically, it uses a recursive algorithm to reverse strings until the user types “done” as 
the entry string.

1. Read in a string from the user.  Prompt her with something like “Enter the string to 
reverse, or ‘done’ to exit. If the user enters “done” then exit.

2. Use a recursive algorithm and implementation to reverse the string.

The program should loop through these two steps until the user indicates they are done.  
For example, if the user entered “Finally” the program would reverse the string so that it 
was “yllaniF” and would display that. Then it would prompt for the next string.*/
